The newly built Connecticut State Library and Supreme Court Building at 231 Capitol Avenue in Hartford was described in 1910 as "one of the most beautiful structures in this country and said by some to be the handsomest building in New England."

Prior to 1910, the State Library was located in the State Capitol, where it had been housed since 1878. By 1906, the space for the Library was inadequate. The collections were dispersed in four locations throughout the building and over 13,000 new items were being received each year. Portraits of the Governors of Connecticut were displayed along the walls, and the Charter of the Colony of Connecticut and other valuable archival material were stored in free-standing vaults.

In his 1906 *Annual Report* State Librarian George Godard comments:
>"It has been my thought and hope that some provisions might be made ...whereby all the books of the library could be brought together, where the several portraits and paintings could be properly and safely hung, where regularly constructed vaults for invaluable records and papers might be accessible, and where rooms or special apartments for study could be provided and proper provisions made for the development and work of our State Library."
